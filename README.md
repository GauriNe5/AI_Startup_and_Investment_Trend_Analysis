# AI_Startup_and_Investment_Trend_Analysis
This project aims to analyze and understand emerging trends in AI startups in USA 2025, focusing on funding trends, industry insights, and investment patterns. By leveraging data-driven insights, this project helps investors, entrepreneurs, and industry analysts explore the growth trajectory of AI startups worldwide.

The project consists of several core components:

1️⃣ Data Collection – Aggregated and cleaned real-world AI startup funding data from multiple sources, handling inconsistencies and missing values.
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Examined funding distribution, investment trends, and key industry sectors to identify patterns and outliers.
3️⃣ Predictive Modeling – Built a machine learning model (Random Forest Regressor) to estimate startup funding based on revenue, employee count, and industry classification.
4️⃣ Interactive Data Visualization – Developed a Streamlit-based dashboard to visualize funding distribution, top-funded industries, and AI startup growth trends.

📊 Key Insights & Visualizations
Funding Distribution: Analyzed before and after imputation to correct missing values.
Industry-wise Investment Trends: Identified the top 10 industries receiving the most funding.
AI Startup Growth Forecasting: Used ML models to predict potential funding based on historical data.

🖥️ Technologies Used
✅ Python – Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data analysis.
✅ Machine Learning – Scikit-learn, Random Forest for predictive modeling.
✅ Web Framework – Streamlit for interactive dashboard deployment.
✅ Deployment – Ready for hosting on Streamlit Cloud, AWS, or Heroku.

🚀 Future Enhancements
🔹 Integrate Real-time Data from Crunchbase API, AngelList, or Growjo.
🔹 Expand ML Models to predict startup success beyond funding.
🔹 Automate Data Updates for dynamic trend analysis.
